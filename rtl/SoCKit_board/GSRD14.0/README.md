To test a customize software IP in GSRD on SoCKit board linux need to be booted from an SD card [0] and these files (preloader-mkimage.bin, soc_system.dtb, soc_system.rbf) need to be updated in the SD card [1]. In this environment the test programs can be copied to the SD card to start with the customize software IP.
