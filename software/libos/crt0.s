# When the processor boots, only one hardware thread will be enabled.  This will
# begin execution at address 0, which will jump immediately to _start.
# This thread will perform static initialization (for example, calling global
# constructors).  When it has completed, it may set a control register to enable 
# the other threads (in main), which will also branch through _start. However, 
# they will branch over the initialization routine and go to main directly.
